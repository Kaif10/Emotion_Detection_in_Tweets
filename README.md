# Friends_emotion-detection-with-NLP
main file(Emotion_detection.ipynb)

I did this project in June 2020. A time when distress was at an all-time high because of killing of an innocent Black Man George Floyed by Amercian Police. A lot of protests were conducted all across the globe. People displayed grief on Twitter and Social Media was filled with grief because of racial in-equality cases and police brutality. So i decided to check on my friends and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey (who was posting a lot of great stuff regarding importance of Racial-Equality and protests) by scraping their tweets with 'twitter_scraper'  and extracting emotion from it with Neural Nets.
   
   I coded a bi-directional LSTM network trained it on emotion-detection dataset and tested it on the recent tweets of 'BlacklivesMatter' movement on twitter. In this project I have also included a file where I have scraped  tweets using Beautiful Soup.
