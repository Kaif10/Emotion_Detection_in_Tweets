# Friend-s_emotion-detection-with-NLP

I did this project in June 2020. A time when distress was very high because of killing of an innocent Black Man George Floyed by Amercian Police. A lot of protests were conducted all across the globe. People displayed grief on Twitter and Social Media was filled with grief because of racial in-equality cases and police brutality. So i decided to check on my friends and Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey(who was posting a lot of great stuff regarding importance of Rcaial-Equality and protests) by scraping their tweets and extracting emotion from it.
